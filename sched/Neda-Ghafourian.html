		<h3>The effect of different mass models on the evolution of disk galaxies</h3><br>

Previous studies of the isolated disk galaxies by using N-body simulations implied that the disk evolution shows distinct characteristics under the effect of a Dark Matter (DM) halo model or by considering the models of modified gravity. However, these studies have assumed a Plummer mass model for the DM halo and an Exponential model for the baryonic disk. In this talk, the results of considering different mass models for the halo and disk will be presented. We will see that despite some minor differences, the overall distinction between the results of DM and modified gravity models, specially in the bar rotation speed of the galaxies, are independent of the mass model.
