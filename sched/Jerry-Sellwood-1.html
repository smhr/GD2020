		<h3>Secular evolution within galaxy disks</h3><br>

It has recently become clear that many aspects of disk galaxy
structure today have been created by secular evolution, with spirals
being one of the principal drivers.  They rearrange the distribution
of angular momentum and mass within the disk, mix stars and gas in a
radially diffusive manner, contribute to increased random motion with
stellar age, flatten rotation curves, etc.  This talk will attempt to
review all these aspects of spiral-driven evolution within a disk
galaxy.
