		<h3>Barred galaxies in modified gravity</h3><br>
		In modified gravity theories that deny the existence of the dark matter particles, naturally, there is no dark matter halo around galaxies. This causes several significant differences with the standard picture as the halo plays a central role in governing the secular evolution of disks. More specifically, the bar evolution and the vertical structure of the disks in modified gravity is meaningfully different from those in the dark matter models. In this talk, focusing on N-body simulations conducted for exponential galaxy disks, I review the main differences and their relevance to real observations.
