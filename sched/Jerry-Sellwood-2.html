		<h3>Capabilities and pitfalls of N-body simulations</h3><br>

		An efficient N-body code is a powerful tool, but using it to do
		science requires care.  The user must be aware of its limitations,
		have an ability to recognize numerical artifacts and, above all, be
		able to create a sensible set of particles from which to start.  This
		talk will dwell all these topics.
