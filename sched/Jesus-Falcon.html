		<h3>Watching secular evolution in action</h3><br>
I will present some recent work from the Fornax3D and TIMER MUSE programs displaying different aspects of secular evolution. I will focus on results connected to the formation of thick disks and the evolution of (double) barred galaxies. The nature and quality of the MUSE integral-field observations allows us to watch the effects of secular evolution in galaxies in action.
