		<h3>Kinematics of stars and gas in brightest group galaxies; the role of group dynamics</h3><br>

		The low-velocity dispersions of galaxy groups make them ideal environments for galaxy interactions and mergers. The impact of mergers on a galaxy may differ depending on the type of merger. Minor mergers are less disruptive but more frequent, while major mergers can significantly transform a galaxy's morphology and dynamics. The impact of a merger on the galaxies gas-dynamic is larger compare to its stellar dynamics. The gas-star position angle offset could persist several Gyrs during the merger by re-accretion of the cold gas in the brightest group galaxies (BGG). The time scale of dynamical settling gas into the central disk depends on the ceaseless of gas accretion could be increased to the range of 80 - 100 dynamical times for early-type BGGs. Dynamically relaxed systems will have had their last major merger or accretion event at least several gigayears ago. Here, I'll present how group dynamical state could impact the kinematic properties of BGGs?. Generally speaking, we find that misalignment between the rotation axis of gas and stars are more frequent in BGG of unrelaxed, while regulate rotators are more common in relaxed systems.
