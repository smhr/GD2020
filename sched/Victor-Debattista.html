		<h3>The impact of spirals on disks: migration and vertical bending modes
</h3><br>

Transient spirals are important drivers of various phenomena in galactic disks.  In this talk I will present some of these effects.  By far the most important is the radial migration of stars.  I will present this phenomenon and describe evidence for it in the Milky Way and in external galaxies.  I will also describe the effect of spirals on breathing motions within the disk; these motions have been seen in the Gaia data and I will discuss these results.  Finally I will show that spirals are responsible for weak bending modes (at best).
